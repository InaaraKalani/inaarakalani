  "I believe in empathy, equality, and using my voice and skills to uplift others—especially those who are unheard or undervalued. As a strong feminist, I’m deeply aware of the societal structures that suppress women and other marginalized voices, and I’m committed to challenging them wherever I can.\n\nMy love for animals, nature, and the environment is rooted in a belief that all life deserves care and respect. Whether through technology, art, or action, I hope to contribute to a more compassionate and just world—one where people are empowered, and kindness isn’t seen as a weakness, but a strength.";
