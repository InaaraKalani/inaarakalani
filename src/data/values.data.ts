  `I believe in empathy and equality, though not in the way they are often oversimplified. ` +
  `Equality is not about treating everyone the same, it’s about recognizing individual needs ` +
  `and ensuring fairness. True change requires more than just words; it needs power, action, ` +
  `and the courage to challenge systems that perpetuate imbalance.\n\nKindness is a strength, ` +
  `but it should never come at your own expense. I believe kindness is meaningful when it  ` +
  `serves both yourself and others, and I don’t believe it should be extended to those who ` +
  `harm or exploit. Empathy, for me, is the ability to deeply sense and understand others, ` +
  `but also to know where to draw boundaries to protect your own strength. \n\nMy love for ` +
  `animals and nature reflects this philosophy. Communicating with creatures who cannot ` +
  `speak teaches a different kind of understanding — one that is rooted in feeling rather than words.`;
